/*Task #10:
Design a program that maintains library book records using dynamic arrays.
=> Each row represents a category (e.g., Fiction, Science, History).
=> Each category has a different number of books (use a jagged array).
=> Store book IDs dynamically and allow the user to search for a given book ID.
=> Print whether the book is available and in which category.*/
